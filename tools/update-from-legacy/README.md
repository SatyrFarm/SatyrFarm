#Legacy Updater
This Updater is for updating old SatyrFarm fields and trees that do not include the update-system yet. It will preserve the current state and percentage and it will add the new products inside.

To update your old fields/trees:

1. Put the **field-dropin-update** script inside the item you want to update.
2. Rezz the Updater and click it.
The Updater will give you many messages in Nearby Chat about the progress. It may take a while.
